- simData: file containing getBioLocation function, used to get chromosome and coordinates of genomics data

- getBioConnection function updated: 2 data frame inputs with id and chromosomal coordinates, 1 data frame output with 3   columns (id1, id2 and scale)

- getBioConnection2 function created: same work with different output (rows are the ids from the first matrix, columns     are ids from the second matrix, and the data correspond to the scales)
